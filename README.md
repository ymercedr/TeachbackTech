# Static, Protected and Private

These three terms are access modifiers that are supported when using TypeScript. They are very useful and their use is highly recommended since it helps preserve the security of the properties and methods within a class, which avoids them being used in unnecesary circumstances. In some cases they can even be used to control the access to important data that should not be breached outside of the intended scope. In TypeScript, the default type of modifier is public, but it is still best practice to state the type even though it is default.

Now let's dive a little bit deeper into each term for further understanding. Starting off with public or static, this means the properties and methods are accesible on a global scale, meaning anywhere in the file, without any restrictions. On another hand, protected type cannot be accesed outside of their class scope, yet their attributes can be used or accesed by child classes when inheritance is seen. Similarly, private modifiers cannot be accessed outside of their designated class, but in this case not even subclasses are allowed to use those attributes.
